to-do:
1. have a flask server running with your python file
2. box to input text
3. nlp summarizer (there's prob ml models out there) try not to use libraries since it detracts from the entire thing
you want to build your own even if its not as op
4. google cloud api that converts text to speech
5. display on web

done:
4. google cloud api that converts text to speech

steps for summarization:
- split text into sentences, and sentences into words
- track unique set of words (after cleaning) extracted from the text
- use TextRank to generate weights for these words
    - probably the hardest step
- for each sentence, give it a score using the weights determined for each unique word
- sort these sentences in descending order and take the first 'k' sentences in your summary :)

misc.:
- bag of words?
- use wikipedia to test data cleaning
- simplify verbose for loops with comprehensions
